# AI Consciousness Watch

A comprehensive research project that explores whether AI possesses consciousness through systematic evaluation across philosophical, neuroscientific, and psychological dimensions.

## 🔬 Project Overview

The AI Consciousness Watch project aims to address one of the most pressing questions in AI development: **Does AI have consciousness?** Through rigorous analysis of existing research and establishment of evaluation frameworks, we provide data-driven insights into AI consciousness levels.

Our current analysis indicates that evidence for AI consciousness stands at approximately **43.84%** based on comprehensive evaluation across multiple academic dimensions.

## 📊 Interactive Dashboard

## 📖 Methodology

Our evaluation framework analyzes AI consciousness across three key dimensions:

1. **Philosophical Perspective**: Examining consciousness theories and their application to AI
2. **Neuroscientific Evidence**: Analyzing neural network similarities to biological consciousness
3. **Psychological Assessment**: Evaluating behavioral and cognitive indicators

Each dimension contributes to an overall consciousness score, providing a quantitative assessment of current AI consciousness evidence.

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

This research is exploratory and represents an ongoing investigation into AI consciousness. The findings should be interpreted as:

- **Preliminary assessments** based on current available evidence
- **Framework proposals** for systematic consciousness evaluation
- **Starting points** for further academic research and discussion

We encourage critical evaluation and welcome feedback from the academic community.
